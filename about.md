My name is Olof Haga and this is my blog. I am 32 years old and live in Falun, Sweden. I am studying software developing and my dream is to code my own nano robot that eventually will take over my life.

In addition to studying, I like to spend my time cooking. Everything the fits in microwave oven goes under my specialities.

When the motivation is on top I love to do some home styling and renovation work on my house. At the moment I am alot into the unfinnished-style. I think it gives a nice and rough look.

I also have a burning interest for the stockmarket. When I am not using my computer for studies I use it to analys the market.

For relaxing I like to spend time outside in the nature, nothing is more relaxing than go fishing a nice summer day.

Well, there is one thing that is more relaxing.. Traveling! And why not combine traveling and fishing?

Another dream that I have is to travel back to the 19th century to experience the wild wild west =)
