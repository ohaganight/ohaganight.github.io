#### humans.txt

humans.txt is for a website what "credits" is for a movie. In humans.txt you write down information about the people behind the website. Who created the website? Who did what? Who was helping you out? It could also contain information about what software that was used for creating the site, and whatever else you want to include.
For this site I put in some basic information about the team behind the site, I also mentioned which IDE and SSG I used and which language its written in.

#### robots.txt

robots.txt is a textfile in where you give information to the search engines. What content on the site you want them to include and what not to include. You can also which engine that is allowed to get the content.

I put both files in my root directory of the site. [humans.txt](../humans.txt) and [robots.txt](../robots.txt)
